HedisC solves the equations of fluiddynamics specialized to
axisymmetric, thin and isothermal systems. Additionally the
equation for disk evolution proposed by Pringle (1981) is
solved. The time integration is performed using an explicit
scheme 4th order or an implicit scheme 2nd order.
For a detailed description of the physics, equations and
the numerical schemes see the publication from M. Blank 2010
"Das Wachstum Schwarzer LÃ¶cher in aktiven galaktischen Kernen"

To run HedisC compile the files in the folder "code" together
with one of the files in the folder "examples" and use the
packages lm, lgslcblas and lgsl.
